<h2>A Tale of Two Cultures</h2>

    <h2><b>Midsummer maypole</b></h2>
    <p>At the centre of the traditional celebrations is the maypole, in Swedish called the Midsommarstången. And if you were thinking there's something rather phallic about a tall pole with two large hoops at the top, that's sort of the point -- many people believe it originated as a symbol of fertility.

      Others say the shape has its roots in Norse mythology, and that it represents an axis linking the underworld, earth, and heavens. Whichever story you choose to believe, there's no denying it's a little strange to have a festival that boils down to erecting a large pole and dancing around it.</p>
      <h2><b>Frog dance</b></h2>
      <p>The peak of the festivities sees the Swedes imitate frogs, hopping around the maypole while singing the classic tune 'Små grodorna' (The small frogs), which describes frogs in (biologically incorrect) detail.

        An excerpt from the lyrics: "The small frogs, the small frogs, are funny to look at. No tails, no tails, they have no tails. No ears, no ears, they have no ears."</p>
        <h2><b>Flower</b></h2>
        <p>You'll see people wearing a flower wreath in their hair, regardless of age and gender. Flowers are also used to dress up the maypole.
    
          According to Swedish tradition, you should also pick seven kinds of flowers (in some parts of Sweden it's nine flowers) and put them underneath your pillow. Then you'll dream about your future husband or wife.</p>
        <h2><b>Strawberry</b></h2>
        <p>Strawberries are another fixture on the Midsummer menu. But for traditionalists, they absolutely have to be Swedish. This results in months of press coverage about the state of the strawberry harvest -- will they be ripe in time for Midsummer? Will the harvest be bigger or smaller than usual? Swedes are fiercely proud of their rather tiny but super sweet variety of strawberries.</p>

    <h2><b>The moon</b></h2>
    <p>One of the most significant symbols of Mid-Autumn Festival is the moon; indeed, the moon is supposedly at its brightest, roundest and biggest on this day each year. In the old days, the Chinese emperor used to lead all the officials to worship the moon and pray for the harvest as they believed that the moon brings rain. Moreover, the round moon also symbolises perfection.</p>
      <h2><b>Reunion</b></h2>
      <p>Family reunion is a key part of the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration. Normally, the whole family gets together in the evening, looks up to the sky and enjoys time together. No matter how far people are away from home, this is the time for family coming together.</p>
        <h2><b>Mooncake</b></h2>
        <p>Almost all Chinese festivals have an emphasis on food, and Mid-Autumn Festival is no exception. Mooncake is the traditional food for celebrating the festival, with the majority of mooncakes being round shape to represent the moon and reunion.</p>
        <h2><b>Lantern</b></h2>
        <p>Lanterns have been associated with the festival since the Tang dynasty, possibly because of their traditional symbolization of fertility. All too appropriate for a harvest festival. The lanterns also serve a practical purpose of lighting the way as friends and family stay up to appreciate the full moon late into the night. In the past, paper lanterns were lit by candlelight. But given safety concerns, these days, you’re more likely to see plastic versions with battery-powered lights in an array of designs.</p>
